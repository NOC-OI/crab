## About

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is still undergoing extensive testing. Many features may be broken or unstable.

CRAB is a FOSS stack for ML dataset management and annotation. It includes preconfigured profiles for importing IFCB and LISST-Holo data. If you have another data format you would like added, please open an issue on GitHub or send me an email. CRAB manages ingesting data, providing all files in a uniform TIFF format on an S3 compatible object store. Metadata is searchable using queries to the integrated CouchDB server, allowing you to easily access data stored on the platform.

## Prerequisites

CRAB requires Docker Compose to run, but otherwise comes with everything you need for a minimal install out of the box. Should you wish to use BIIGLE integrations, you will need to install BIIGLE seperately. Work is ongoing to integrate BIIGLE into this deployment, for now follow instructions for [BIIGLE](https://biigle-admin-documentation.readthedocs.io/installation/) seperately.

## Installation

For a local install, run `flask/build.sh` first.
Then run `generate-env.sh` to auto-generate a `.env` file.
If you're using externally managed S3 compatible storage, edit the `.env` file now and skip running `init-db.sh`. You'll need to configure databases manually.
Run `init-db.sh` to prepare your databases automatically.
Finally, run `launch.sh` to start your instance.
CRAB should now be avaliable on `http://localhost:8080`
